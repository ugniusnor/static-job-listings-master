## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my job listing project


## The challenge


Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Filtering

Filtering is done using Vanilla JS , however in the future i'd love to make this project using React JS
